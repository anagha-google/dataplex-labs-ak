# M8-2: Create an overview in Dataplex Catalog for a Catalog Entry

A Dataplex tag template is a metadata template for attributes you want to attach to an entry. You can use available tag templates or create a custom tag template based on your unique requirements and persist to Dataplex Catalog. You can then associate the same template with a Catalog entry - with values populated for the attributed you defined.

In this lab module, we will learn how to create create a tag tenplate and attach to the Chicago Crimes custom entry from the prior module.

```
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Data Fulfillment and Analysis Division of the Chicago Police Department at DFA@ChicagoPolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time.
