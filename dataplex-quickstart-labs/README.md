# Dataplex Quickstart for Cloud Architects and Engineers

## 1. About

Dataplex is a Google Cloud service for Data Governance and Management. Using Dataplex and complementary Data Analytics services, enterprises can stand up Data Mesh architecture in their Google Cloud data estate. To get started with Data Mesh on Google Cloud, one of the prerequisites is knowledge of Dataplex.<br>

This repository is designed to demystify Dataplex features, through a series of self-contained instructional lab modules, with minimal automation, detailed instructions with screenshots for the full developer experience. Once you are well versed with dataplex, you can proceeed to the advanced labs that feature Data Mesh. The labs are product sponsored and you can expect to see new modules released as and when there are new features/updates to features announced.
